# [3.0.0](https://github.com/jdalrymple/node-gitlab/tags/3.0.0) (2018-4-2)

- Exporting all services separately ie. const { Projects } from 'gitlab'; as well as the usual default export: const Gitlab from 'gitlab'
- Exporting bundles which are groups of related API's. These include: ProjectsBundle, UsersBundle and GroupsBundle
- Added events support to the Projects, and Users
- Added full support for ProjectVariables and GroupVariables
- Added support for Events. This is also exposed in Projects and Users under the events function

### Breaking Changes between 2.2.6 and 3.0.0

- Instantiation of the API must use the new operator consistently. See usage above.
- All services being exported are not capitalized for clarity that they are themselves api's and not properties. ie. Gitlab.Projects vs Gitlab.projects
- All subservices (services exposed as properties of other services) have been moved out into their own service

```
ProjectRepository -> Repositories, Tags, Commits, Branches and RepositoryFiles
Users -> Users, UserKeys, UserGPGKeys, UserCustomAttributes, UserVariables

```

- Moved createTodo function from MergeRequests API to Todos API
- Many services have been renamed:

```
ProjectProtectedBranches -> ProtectedBranches
