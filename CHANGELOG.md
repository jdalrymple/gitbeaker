- Updated Approvals API support to match https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/merge_request_approvals.html

- NotificationSettings API edit function now takes one parameter, `options`
- Changing the access level enum property from master to maintainer as per https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/42751
- Notes now require a body argument instead of checking the options argument for a body parameter
- Bumped min node version to > v10 LTS

### Breaking Changes between 2.2.6 and 3.0.0

- Instantiation of the API must use the new operator consistently. See usage above.
- All services being exported are not capitalized for clarity that they are themselves api's and not properties. ie. Gitlab.Projects vs Gitlab.projects
- All subservices (services exposed as properties of other services) have been moved out into their own service

```
ProjectRepository -> Repositories, Tags, Commits, Branches and RepositoryFiles
Users -> Users, UserKeys, UserGPGKeys, UserCustomAttributes, UserVariables

```

- Moved createTodo function from MergeRequests API to Todos API
- Many services have been renamed:

```
ProjectProtectedBranches -> ProtectedBranches
ProjectDeployKeys -> DeployKeys
ProjectEnvironments -> Environments
ProjectJobs -> Jobs
ProjectLabels -> Labels
ProjectPipelines -> Pipelines
ProjectRepository -> Repositories
ProjectServices -> Services
ProjectTriggers -> Triggers
```

- Some services were merged:

```
Issues = ProjectIssues + Issues.  ProjectId is optional for all()
MergeRequests = ProjectMergeRequests + MergeRequests + MergeRequestsChanges + MergeRequestsCommits + MergeRequestVersions. ProjectId is optional for all()
Runners = ProjectRunners + Runners. ProjectId is optional for all()

```
