# node-gitlab-api

[GitLab](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq) API NodeJS library.
It wraps the HTTP v4 API library described [here](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/tree/master/doc/api).

## Install

```bash
# Install from npm
npm install node-gitlab-api
```

## Usage
### Import
#### ES6 (>=node 8.0.0)
URL to your GitLab instance should not include `/api/v4` path.

Instantiate the library using a basic token created in your [Gitlab Profile](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html)
```javascript
const GitlabAPI = require('node-gitlab-api')({
  url:   'http://example.com', // Defaults to http://gitlab.com
  token: 'abcdefghij123456'	//Can be created in your profile. 
})
```

Or, use a OAuth token instead!

```javascript
const GitlabAPI = require('node-gitlab-api')({
  url:   'http://example.com', // Defaults to http://gitlab.com
  oauthToken: 'abcdefghij123456'
})
```

Using basic http authentication with token
```javascript
const GitlabAPI = require('node-gitlab-api')({
  url:   'http://example.com', // Defaults to http://gitlab.com
  token: 'abcdefghij123456'
  basicAuth: { 'user': 'jhonny', 'pass': "boy" }
})
```
#### ES5
The same parameters as above, but the require url inclues a `/dist/es5`:

```javascript
const GitlabAPI = require('node-gitlab-api/dist/es5')({
  ...
})
```

### Examples
Once you have your library instantiated, you can utilize many of the API's functionality:

Using the await/async method

```javascript
// Listing users
let users = await GitlabAPI.users.all();
```

Or using Promise-Then notation
```javascript
// Listing projects
GitlabAPI.projects.all()
.then((projects) => {
	console.log(projects)
})
```

General rule about all the function parameters:
- If its a required parameter, it is a named argument in the functions
- If its an optional parameter, it is defined in a options object following the named arguments

ie. 

```javascript
GitlabAPI.projects.create(projectId, {
	//options defined in the Gitlab API documentation
})
```

### Pagination

For any .all() function on a resource, it will return all the items from Gitlab. This can be troublesome if there are many items, as the request it self can take a while to be fulfilled. As such, a maxPages option can be passed to limit the scope of the all function.


```javascript
// Listing projects
let projects = await GitlabAPI.projects.all({max_pages:2});

```

You can also use this in conjunction to the perPage argument which would override the default of 30 per page set by Gitlab:

```javascript
// Listing projects
let projects = await GitlabAPI.projects.all({max_pages:2, per_page:40});

```

## Docs

Although there are the official docs for the API, below are some additional docs for this node package! Would eventually like to document everything, but there is quite a bit to document. PR's are welcome! ðŸ˜Ž

------------------
- Initial release
- TODO: Tests, Examples

## Development

To get this running locally rather than from your `node_modules` folder:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jdalrymple/node-gitlab-api.git
$ cd node-gitlab-api
$ npm install
$ npm build
```

And then inside whatever project you are using `node-gitlab-api` in you change your references to use that repo.  In your package.json of that upstream project change:

```json
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "node-gitlab-api": "2.1.0"
    ...
  }
```

to this

```json
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "node-gitlab-api": "<path-to-your-clone>"
    ...
  }
```
